![Demo](https://github.com/DavidBevi/vivaldi_trapezoid_tabs/blob/main/demo.gif?raw=true)

## Installation
1. **Enable support for CSS mods** - *This must be done only once per Vivaldi installation*
   - Go to `vivaldi://experiments/` and Tick `Allow for using CSS modifications`

2. **Download the CSS mod `slanted_tabs.css`**
   - You'll have to tell Vivaldi where you saved your file, so chose a folder you plan not to change
   - [Click here to download the file](https://github.com/DavidBevi/vivaldi_trapezoid_tabs/releases/download/v1/slanted_tabs.css) and save it in said folder

3. **Load the CSS mod in Vivaldi**
   - Open Vivaldi settings
   - Go to `Appearance` and scroll down until you reach `Custom UI Modifications`
   - Click on `Select Folder` and select the folder that contains `slanted_tabs.css`</br>*Note: This will load EVERY CSS file within the folder selected*

4. **Restart Vivaldi** (Tip: go to `vivaldi://restart`)
